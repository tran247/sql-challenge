# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I am a data engineer from the company Pewlett Hackard. 
I am tasked with researching employees from the 1980's and 1990s. 
I will be designing the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.
I will be performing duties of a data engineer and a data analyst.
Data Engineer:
1. Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
2. Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 
Data Analys:
1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
